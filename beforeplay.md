Hi, you probably clicked here after you read the first page of notes, [if you didn't read, click here before you play.](https://patoflamejantetv.github.io/UnnamedHorrorGame/)
This game uses some Lomando assets (such as shouts, Elizabeth's mask, among others). (pls dont sue me).

GET OUT NOW IF YOU HAVE ANY CARDIAC PROBLEM OR EPILEPSY!

This game is still under development, if you see a page such as "404" or "This page does not exist", it is because the level is still under development, so this error appears.
If you want to contact me, you can talk to me via discord (@patoflamentetv) or via email (flamejantepato77@gmail.com).
