# UnnamedHorrorGame
UnnamedHorrorGame's HTML levels, made with Turbowarp.

I used some (1~2) assets from the japanese horror game Lomando.com

The first level is [cryingone](https://patoflamejantetv.github.io/UnnamedHorrorGame/cryingone)

Also, you can freely stream my game and make fangames/mods/custom levels/fork of this game, just please read the [LICENSE.md](./LICENCE.md before making any thing!
