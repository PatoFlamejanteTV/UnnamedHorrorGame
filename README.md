# PROJECT UHC - UnnamedHorrorGame
UnnamedHorrorGame's HTML levels, made with Turbowarp.

I used some (1~2) assets from the japanese horror game Lomando.com

The first level is [cryingone](https://patoflamejantetv.github.io/UnnamedHorrorGame/cryingone)

Also, you can freely stream my game and make fangames/mods/custom levels/fork of this game, just please read the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) before making any thing!

Also, some of the level name is in Brazillian Portuguese (like "elenaoerabemvindo.html"). All puzzles are in English, its ok make an FNF mod or something else with my project.

If you wanna see the Github Repo with all the levels, [click here](https://github.com/PatoFlamejanteTV/UnnamedHorrorGame/tree/main), if you wanna check my Youtube Channel, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/@patoflamejantetv)(note: i only make videos in Brazillian Portuguese).
