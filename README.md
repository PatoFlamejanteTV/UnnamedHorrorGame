# PROJECT UHG - UnnamedHorrorGame
UnnamedHorrorGame's levels, made with Turbowarp and with love ♥️

I used some (1~2) assets from the japanese horror game [Lomando.com](lomando.com)

[Click here to play the game (and also read some notes before playing).](https://patoflamejantetv.github.io/UnnamedHorrorGame/beforeplay)

Also, you can freely stream my game and make fangames/mods/custom levels/fork of this game, just please read the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) before making any thing!

Also, some of the level name is in Brazillian Portuguese (like "elenaoerabemvindo.html"). All puzzles are in English, its ok make an FNF mod or something else with my project.

If you wanna see the Github Repo with all the levels, [click here](https://github.com/PatoFlamejanteTV/UnnamedHorrorGame/tree/main), if you wanna check my Youtube Channel, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/@patoflamejantetv) (note: i only make videos in Brazillian Portuguese!).

The game was originally created because of the latest levels of Pasta58, and because they do not fit the same aesthetics as other levels.

Game levels do not have exactly an order, the game does not have a lore either, which means that you can start from any level or from anywhere, that you will never get lost (except parts where you need to decorate a number or a sequence of forms).

Note: The game is not 100% horror, some parts are just psychological terror or "pauses", if someone says this is not a horror game, this game IS a horror game, but not as other games (FNAF , etc.). If you played the "Lomando" game, you will most likely know what I'm talking about.
